Docker commands crash:

syntax : docker <what element of docker you wanna use i.e., container/images/config/system/service/volume/context/network/node etc> <what action you wanna perform with that element run/stop/restart/kill/logs/push/pull/rename etc.> <additional options such as publish/detach etc.> <container/image name>

eg:
docker container run --publish 80:80 --detach --name webhost nginx 

We have to first stop a container before removing it. If the container is not stopping,then
to remove docker container which is running without stopping it

docker container rm -f <containerID>

To remove the docker images 
docker rmi <image name or image id>

To check what are the configs used in the containers while starting up
docker container inspect <container name>

To check the CPU, memory utilization, IO stats of the contaner
docker stats <container name>

To check the processes running inside a container
docker container top <container name>

To go inside a container that is already running:
docker container exec -it <container name> bash

To go inside a new container which we gonna run,
docker container run -it <container name> <shell>

To check the port to which the container is listening to 
docker container port <container name>

To check the IP address used by the container:
docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <container name>

We can create multiple virtual networks inside the OS and make containers under those virtual networks. Bridge network drive allows the containers to talk to each other when running on the same docker host.

To list the default network drivers
docker network ls

To create a new network
docker network create <network name>

To check the IP address, gateway of a network
docker network inspect <network name>

To create a container under a specific network
docker container run -d --name <container name> --network <network name> <image name>

To attach another network to a running container
docker network connect <network name> <running container name>

To check the details of the networks a container is attached to
docker container inspect <container name>

To check the details of the containers attached to a particular network
docker network inspect <container>

To remove a particular network from the container
docker network disconnect <networ drive name> <container name>

Docker containers inside a non-default network (bridge network) i.e., the network we created, can talk to each other using the DNS. The container name by default becomes their DNS name. So if the containers under the same non-default network gets restarted and their IP address gets changed, they can still ping each other due to their DNS name. Default bridge network does not offer this DNS feature by default to the containers using its network. It has to be manually created through link option (docker container run -d -n <container name> -link)



Assignment : To check the curl version on two new containers Ubunty (14.04) and centos (7)

docker container run -itd --name ubuntu_ass ubuntu:14.04
docker container run -itd --name centos_ass centos:7

docker container exec centos_ass curl --version
Output:
curl 7.29.0 (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.29.0 NSS/3.44 zlib/1.2.7 libidn/1.28 libssh2/1.8.0
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smtp smtps telnet tftp

docker container exec ubuntu_ass curl --version
Output:
OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:380: starting container process caused: exec: "curl": executable file not found in $PATH: unknown

The above output in the ubuntu container shows that the curl library is not installed by default
Need to install the curl inside the ubuntu container:
Commands:
docker container exec -it ubuntu_ass apt-get update
docker container exec -it ubuntu_ass apt-get install curl

Now the curl is installed inside the ubuntu container.
Validate the curl version now:
docker container exec -it ubuntu_ass curl --version
Output:
curl 7.35.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.35.0 OpenSSL/1.0.1f zlib/1.2.8 libidn/1.28 librtmp/2.3
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtmp rtsp smtp smtps telnet tftp 
Features: AsynchDNS GSS-Negotiate IDN IPv6 Largefile NTLM NTLM_WB SSL libz TLS-SRP 

How to check the version of a particular software

The below command will provide the curl version of a centos v7 linux OS by temporarily creating a container of that OS and finding the curl version:
docker container run --rm --name centos centos:7 curl --version
Output:
curl 7.29.0 (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.29.0 NSS/3.44 zlib/1.2.7 libidn/1.28 libssh2/1.8.0
Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop3 pop3s rtsp scp sftp smtp smtps telnet tftp 

Once the above command is executed, the container will terminate and it wont be appering under both ls and ls -a commands for docker container.

Assignment : Round Robin Test DNS

Create a dedicated network:
docker network create dude

Create two containers (elasticsearch) with same network and same name with DNS name (--net-alias)
docker container run -itd --net dude --net-alias search elasticsearch:2
docker container run -itd --net dude --net-alias search elasticsearch:2

Since we did not mention the name of the container, the docker assumes a name to the containers and that will be the container's default DNS name. All we do is set an additional DNS name using (--net-alias)

Now try to create a temporary alpine (linux) container under the same n/w as the above elasticsearch container and do a ping to the above created elastic search, you can see that the IP address of the DNS "search" is getting switched b/w the two elasticsearch containers.

docker container run --rm --net dude alpine ping search

To download an image from docker hub repository:
docker pull <imagename>

To login to your dockerhub account
docker login 
This will create a config.json under .docker folder in your home directory

In order to create new lables for the existing image,
docker tag image <Image Repository name> <New Image Name>
Example:
docker image ls
REPOSITORY   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
nginx        latest    0e901e68141f   8 days ago      142MB

docker image tag nginx chidadockersundar/nginx
docker image ls
REPOSITORY                TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
chidadockersundar/nginx   latest    0e901e68141f   8 days ago      142MB
nginx                     latest    0e901e68141f   8 days ago      142MB




Dockerfile
FROM : Minimal distribution (OS in a very smaller size) Eg: Ubuntu:latest
ENV: Environment variable (mostly the verion in key and value pair) Eg: NGINX_VERSION 1.11.10-1-jessie
RUN: Exection of shell commands inside the container. Add && at the end of each commands to make sure that they are part of the same layer.
WORKDIR: To change the present working directory inside the container
EXPOSE: List the ports you would like to open inside the container. 
CMD: Final command which will run when you start, run the container

Protip: Docker always caches the image whenever we build it and then for the subsequent changes that we make in the dockerfile, it will build only the lines that got changed and also will build the lines under the ones which we changed. So if you are creating a dockerfile, please make sure to put the steps that may require frequent changes at the last part of your docker file.

To build the docker image:
docker image build -t <tag name of the image you wanna give> <in which directory you wanna build the file>


Create an apache and tomcat containers.
Make the apache as a front end for the accessing the application deployed in tomcat

Tomcat Dockerfile (tomcatdockerfile)

FROM tomcat:latest
WORKDIR /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
COPY SampleWebApp.war SampleWebApp.war


Apache Dockerfile¸(apachedockerfile)

FROM httpd:latest
WORKDIR /usr/local/apache2/conf
copy httpd.conf httpd.conf


1. Build the images first 
	docker build -t myapache -f apachedockerfile .
	docker build -t mytomcat -f tomcatdockerfile .
2. Create a dedicated network 
	docker network create my_app_net
3. Create both apache and Tomcat containers under this dedicated network. Make sure to give the tomcat container name as mytomcat
	docker container run -d -p 8080:8080 --network my_app_net --name mytomcat chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest
	docker container run -d -p 80:80 --network my_app_net --name myapache chidadockersundar/myapache:latest

4. Hit the URL


Now to push the image, first change the label from myapache, mytomcat to <dockerusername>/<imagename>
docker image tag myapache:latest chidadockersundar/myapache:latest
docker image tag mytomcat:latest chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest

Then push the image:
docker image push chidadockersundar/myapache:latest
docker image push chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Docker Swarm:
docker info |grep -i swarm
 Swarm: inactive

 By default swarm is inactive and you need to activate the swarm :
 docker swarm init


Once the docker swarm is initiated, you can use other swarm features like nodes, service etc.

By default, a node is initiated with a manager when the swarm is initiated.
docker node ls
ID                            HOSTNAME           STATUS    AVAILABILITY   MANAGER STATUS   ENGINE VERSION
4gr1fmgtz5kctidsmgaa4ovz6 *   ip-172-31-32-216   Ready     Active         Leader           20.10.14

You can create a service after this. 
A docker "service" is one or more containers with the same image running under docker's swarm mode. Docker run is running multiple containers with different images in each.
If you stop a container which was created using docker run command, the container will be stopped. But if you try to stop a container created using docker service, the container will be stopped for a moment and it gets started in few seconds.

To create a docker service of the image chidadockersundar/mytomcat,
docker service create -p 8080:8080 --name mytomcat chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest

To check if the servie is created well, use below command. You can see a service ID being created. Also in the Replicas colum, you can see there is by default one replica of this container being initiated:
docker service ls
ID             NAME       MODE         REPLICAS   IMAGE                               PORTS
mthe11dnaxna   mytomcat   replicated   1/1        chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest   *:8080->8080/tcp

Create multiple replicas using:
docker service update --replicas 2 <service id>

To check the containers list now,
docker container ls
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                               COMMAND             CREATED          STATUS          PORTS      NAMES
cc6af17f3563   chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest   "catalina.sh run"   11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes   8080/tcp   mytomcat.1.x39tk5xd6lhxulwkjdvpexqzt
93b555a1771a   chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest   "catalina.sh run"   11 minutes ago   Up 11 minutes   8080/tcp   mytomcat.2.d47l6mk83arpruzhgz15xg882


To know the life cycle of the replicas you created within a service, use below command:
docker service ps <service id>
ID             NAME             IMAGE                               NODE               DESIRED STATE   CURRENT STATE            ERROR                         PORTS

ywgae9plggsp    \_ mytomcat.1   chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest   ip-172-31-32-216   Shutdown        Failed 14 minutes ago    "task: non-zero exit (137)"   
d47l6mk83arp   mytomcat.2       chidadockersundar/mytomcat:latest   ip-172-31-32-216   Running         Running 10 minutes ago

To remove the service,
docker service rm <service name>



To create docker swarm cluster on 3 different VMs.
I used play-with-docker to create 3 VMs for free (only for 4 hours)

Once 3 nodes are created in the website, on the node01
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <IP of the node>

	Swarm initialized: current node (fq1c3tj5k2n24rmtp9lk70aj6) is now a manager.

	To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    	docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-1acdr7vxhsqhbj7gurk5udaljq8q7tzbvxpgvhl48a6wlwtgpd-15ltbpqjroywdirj7pq3zogx9 192.168.0.13:2377

	To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.


By default, node01 becomes a manager (leader)

Now make node02 and node03 to be the workers of this manager





Docker slideshow notes:
Why moving towards container is a master stroke:

As the times changes, the traditional Banks are not just competing only with other banks. They are now competing with Fintech companies like Paypal, Revolt who are rolling out new features almost every week..!
For banks, in order to cope up with the competition against the fintech companies, they need to speed up their innovation and the deployment cycles. 
Traditional banks are under a constant pressure to be more agile with their software delivery in order to build better and more fully featured online experiences for their customers.

Containers are an incredibly powerful toolset which makes it easier to build, ship and run applications. By leveraging these tools, banks can solve the challenge of needing to innovate against a complex, interconnected legacy software environment.

For a bank like ABN AMRO which is relying heavily on its Mainframe systems for majority of its applications, zCX opens a wider window, allowing the bank to TO INNOVATE AND SHIP EVEN MORE HIGH QUALITY SOFTWARE MORE FREQUENTLY THAN BEFORE”

	



Advantages of Containers:
More Consistant operation: applications in containers will run the same, regardless of where they are deployed
Less Overhead: Containers require less system resources than traditional or hardware virtual machine environments because they don’t include operating system images.
Better app development: Containers support agile and DevOps efforts to accelerate development, test, and production cycles.
Increased Portability: Applications running in containers can be deployed easily to multiple different operating systems and hardware platforms. 
Greater Efficiency: Containers allow applications to be more rapidly deployed, patched, or scaled.
